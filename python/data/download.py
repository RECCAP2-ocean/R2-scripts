    """
    A simple wrapper around the pooch package that makes downloading files easier
    
    Removes the need to set the hash of the file and the name is taken from the url. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    url: str
        The url of the file to download
    path: str
        The destination to which the file will be downloaded. Must exist
        and must have write permission
    name: str | None
        By default [None], will get the file name from the url, or can be 
        set to a string. 
    progress: bool [True]
        Show a progress bar for downloading without having to specify the 
        downloader. 
    decompress: bool [True]
        if the file name contains an extension that is a known compressed 
        format, the file will automatically be decompressed and the 
        decompressed files will be returned 
    **kwargs: key-value
        any standard inputs of pooch 
        
    Returns
    -------
    str | list:
        if only a single entry is downloaded / decompressed, then a string will
        be returned, otherwise, a list will be returned
